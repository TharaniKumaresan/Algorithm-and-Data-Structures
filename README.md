# Algorithm-and-Data-Structures
Project 1:
--> We have implemented the comparison of sorting algorithms using 
python as programming language on jupyter notebook.
--> Open the file “Tharani_kumaresan_Project1.ipynb” in the 
jupyter notebook.

I used three distinct sorts of inputs to test the sorting algorithms:
• Random input
• Sorted input
• Reversely sorted input


Project 2:
--> We have implemented the Singles-source shortest path algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Strongly Connected Components (SSCs) using 
python as programming language on jupyter notebook.
--> Open the file “SaiPrathyushaPotu_Project2.ipynb” in the 
jupyter notebook.

We used four distinct directed/undirected graphs input to test.
